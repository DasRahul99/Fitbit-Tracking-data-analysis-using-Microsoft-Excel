In this project, Fitbit fitness tracker data was analyzed in Microsoft Excel to uncover smart device usage trends and customer behaviors, helping the analytic team of WeFit provide business solutions. The dataset included daily activity metrics like total steps, distance covered, exercise done, as well as health-related data like calories, BMI, weight, height, heart rate, blood pressure, and sleep-related data like total sleep time and time spent in bed. Microsoft Excel functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV, MAX, and MIN were applied to perform essential calculations on the data. Sorting functions like SORT, SORTBY, and RANK helped identify the top-performing customers based on different metrics like steps, exercise, or sleep. Pivot tables were used to summarize the data, and conditional formatting was applied to highlight important trends. Graphs like line charts, pie charts, and bar charts were used to visualize the results, making it easier to spot correlations. Lastly, a dashboard was created to bring all the insights together, providing the WeFit team with a comprehensive summary to guide marketing strategies and attract new clients.
